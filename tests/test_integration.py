# Placeholder for integration tests
# These would typically involve starting the Proxy, some Workers,
# and then using a client (like a simplified benchmark client)
# to send requests and verify routing, metrics updates, etc.

# Example:
# async def test_proxy_routes_to_single_worker():
#     # 1. Start Proxy
#     # 2. Start 1 Worker, wait for registration
#     # 3. Send a request via a test client to Proxy
#     # 4. Verify worker receives it and responds
#     # 5. Verify client receives response
#     # 6. Cleanup (stop proxy and worker)
#     pass

# async def test_round_robin_distribution():
#     # 1. Start Proxy (RoundRobin)
#     # 2. Start 2 Workers, wait for registration
#     # 3. Send 2 requests
#     # 4. Verify each worker got one request (check proxy logs or worker processed counts)
#     # 5. Cleanup
#     pass

# These require more setup and are more complex than unit tests.
